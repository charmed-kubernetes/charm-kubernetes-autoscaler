summary: |
  Provide this charm application with credentials to add/remove units from 
  an existing juju deployed kubernetes, and the cluster will resize number
  of worker nodes based on the needs of scale. Node groups are defined by
  the application name in the deployed model.

  examples)
   scale = 3:5:kubernetes-worker      # indicates 3 to 5 nodes
   scale = 0:10 kubernetes-worker-gpu # indicates 0 to 10 nodes of GPU based workers
  
  the autoscaler will not create a cluster, but will grow and shrink as demand requires
